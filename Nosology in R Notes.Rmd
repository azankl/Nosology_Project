Nosology in R Ideas

Make Nosology more useful by providing Nosology data in a format that is 1) machine-readable, 2) re-usable
Use this data to make a human readable website that displays the data in different ways

What kind of information do we want to link?

Diseases to genes
Example: 
```{r}
grViz("diagram.gv")
```

Stickler good example to work out model, maybe gene comes first?

Stickler_4 caused by AR nonsense mutations in COL11A1, thus likely haploinsuff for COL11A1
MED_6 caused by AD in-frame deletion of certain exons in COL11A1, thus likely more specific disease mechanism
that explains the different phenotype, how to model this?
